<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains
detailed reports of adverse events following vaccine administration.
However, efficiently and accurately searching for specific infor-
mation from VAERS poses significant challenges, especially for
medical experts. Natural language querying (NLQ) methods tackle
the challenge by translating the input questions into executable
queries, allowing for the exploration of complex databases with
large amounts of information. Most existing studies focus on the
relational database and solve the Text-to-SQL task. However, the
capability of full-text for Text-to-SQL is greatly limited by the data
structures and functionality of the SQL databases. In addition, the
potential of natural language querying has not been comprehen-
sively explored in the healthcare domain. To overcome these limita-
tions, we investigate the potential of NoSQL databases, specifically
Elasticsearch, and forge a new research direction for NLQ, which
we refer to as Text-to-ESQ generation. This exploration requires
us to re-design various aspects of NLQ, such as the target applica-
tion and the advantages of NoSQL database. In our approach, we
develop a two-stage controllable (TSC) framework consisting of
a question-to-question (Q2Q) translation module and an ESQ
condition extraction (ECE) module. These modules are carefully
designed to efficiently retrieve information from the VEARS data
stored in a NoSQL database. Additionally, we construct a dedicated
question-ESQ pair dataset called VAERSESQ, to support the task
in the healthcare domain. Extensive experiments were conducted
on the VAERSESQ dataset to evaluate the proposed methods. The
results, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrate the accuracy
and efficiency of our approach in generating queries for NoSQL
databases, thus enabling efficient retrieval of VEARS data.
